# Irys NFT Portal
(This README is subject to change anytime)

A decentralized NFT minting platform that empowers users to mint NFTs using artwork and metadata stored permanently on **Irys**. The platform is designed to promote community creativity, enable limitless minting, and showcase the power of Irys for onchain data storage.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a lightweight, community-driven NFT minting dApp built to promote the capabilities of **Irys** — a permanent and scalable data layer. Users can:

- Select preloaded character images or submit their own artwork.
- Add custom descriptions to personalize their NFTs.
- Store both the image and metadata directly on Irys.
- Mint NFTs by connecting their wallet (e.g. MetaMask) and confirming a transaction.

### Why Irys?

- ✅ No pinning
- ✅ No gateways
- ✅ No centralized infra
- ✅ Data never disappears
- ✅ Direct integration with Arweave via Irys fast layer
