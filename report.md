# High Issues

## H-1: Uninitialized State Variables

Solidity does initialize variables by default when you declare them, however it's good practice to explicitly declare an initial value. For example, if you transfer money to an address we must make sure that the address has been initialized.

	```solidity
	    uint256 private _nextTokenId;
	```

# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
	contract IrysNFT is ERC721, ERC721Burnable, AccessControl, ReentrancyGuard {
	```

	```solidity
	    function setBlacklist(string memory tokenURI, bool status) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

	pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

</details>



## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

	    function getNFTMintCount(string memory tokenURI) public view returns (uint256) {
	```

</details>



## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```

</details>



## L-5: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.
